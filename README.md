# Scripts Used in the Bat Coat Color Project
Scripts used primarily to parse or transform the bat coat color dataset (a bunch of genes).


## Python Scripts

Some of these are more useful than others. Their use case as they are is pretty specific to the file structure and naming scheme of this project but they can likely be altered to serve other needs if necessary!

### blastRenamer

This script goes through a set of fasta files and reformats the header of each fasta query present in a file. For the purposes of this project, each fasta file represented a species, containing about 1000 gene sequences/headers. This script will specifically convert headers in the following manner:

Original header:
>ID=>Antrozous_pallidus.ENSG00000100596.8_ENST00000556607.1_SPTLC2.match_part1;Target=>Antrozous_pallidus.ENSG00000100596.8_ENST00000556607.1_SPTLC2(-)

New header:
>Antrozous_pallidus_SPTLC2_part1_ENSG00000100596.8_ENST00000556607.1

New headers in include the following inforation from left to right:
- Species name
- gene name
- match_part number
- ensembl gene ID
- ensembl transcript ID

When changing headers, this script is designed to account for subspecies names within the data set (such as Murina_aurata_feae) and genes lacking a common name/symbol (will default to being called "noName")

To use this script, change the variable named "filePath" to correspond to a folder of fasta files. The script create a new folder called "RenamedBlastFiles" and output to it. The script will output a file for every input file.

For output file naming to work, the script expects every input file to end with ".tblastn.fa". Output names will be the same, only with ".newname" being inserted before ".tblastn.fa". 

This script is designed for windows, but can be tweaked for unix systems (change instances of "\\" to "/")

## BASH Scripts

These scripts are either for file manipulation or program execution.
