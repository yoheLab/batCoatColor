# Scripts Used in the Bat Coat Color Project
Scripts used primarily to parse or transform the bat coat color dataset (a bunch of genes).


## Python Scripts

Some of these are more useful than others. Their use case as they are is pretty specific to the file structure and naming scheme of this project but they can likely be altered to serve other needs if necessary! 

## BASH Scripts

These scripts are either for file manipulation or program execution.
